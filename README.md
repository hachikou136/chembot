# Chembot

This repository is forked from Chembotüêô

And the bot is available on [chembot - Replit](https://replit.com/@hachikou136/chembot)üí™

Chembot is a chemistry discord bot built on the Python package [chemlib](https://github.com/chemlib/chemlib) that provides easy access to element data and quickly performs calculations.

## main points fixed from origin repositoryüõ†

Mainly changed to accommodate changing specification after discord.py version 2.0.

1. dealt with changing specification about intents after discord.py version 2.0.(ref: [what does 'TypeError: BotBase.__init__() missing 1 required keyword-only argument: 'intents'' mean and how do i fix it : discordbots](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordbots/comments/x6ljgk/what_does_typeerror_botbase_init_missing_1/))
2. dealt with changing specification about a method `Bot.load_extension` after discord.py version 2.0.(ref: [python - "RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'BotBase.load_extension' was never awaited" after updating discord.py - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71504627/runtimewarning-coroutine-botbase-load-extension-was-never-awaited-after-upd))
3. fixed to keep alive the bot to work at replit.
4. stopped loading an extension `quiz.py`, because the extension did not work by an error about PyPDF.
5. stopped using a file `token.txt` to set bot token for security reason to work as replit machine. and, using an environment variable via a replit feature `secret` instead.
